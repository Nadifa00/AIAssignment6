## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

### Q1: Edge AI vs Cloud AI
Edge AI processes data locally on devices instead of sending it to the cloud.  
This **reduces latency** because decisions happen instantly without network delays, and **enhances privacy** since sensitive data stays on the device.  
**Example:** In autonomous drones, Edge AI enables real-time obstacle detection and navigation without needing an internet connection.

### Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI
**Classical AI** relies on traditional processors and sequential computation, while **Quantum AI** uses qubits that can represent multiple states simultaneously, allowing faster solutions to complex optimization problems.  
Industries that could benefit most include **finance** (portfolio optimization), **logistics** (route planning), **pharmaceuticals** (drug discovery), and **energy** (grid optimization).
